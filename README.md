# 🚴‍♂️✨ Revitalizing Sales Insights for The Bike Haven: A Tableau Dashboard Transformation. 📊🔍

🚀 Overview 🚲
This project involves the creation of an interactive and informative sales dashboard for "The Bike Haven," a thriving bike shop located in San Francisco. The goal is to enhance online sales reports by transitioning from static reports to visually appealing and easy-to-interpret dashboards. The project was initiated by Chris, the sales manager at The Bike Haven, who aimed to gain deeper insights into sales performance and track various key metrics.

📊 Data Preprocessing 🛠️
To begin the project, the provided dataset was imported into pgAdmin, containing tables for customers, sales, dates, products, categories, subcategories, and geography. SQL queries were employed to merge tables where necessary, such as combining product, category, and subcategory tables, as well as joining customer and geography tables. Unnecessary columns were removed, and the preprocessed data was then exported in CSV format for loading into Tableau Desktop.

🖥️ Tableau Dashboard Creation 📈
Using Tableau Desktop, the data was connected, and a visually interactive dashboard was crafted to meet the specified requirements. The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

📈 Top 10 Products by Sales Amount
A bar chart was created to showcase the top 10 products generating the most revenue for the company. This provides a quick overview of the highest-performing products.

👥 Top 10 Customers
A bar chart was implemented to identify the top 10 customers based on sales, enabling a focus on providing excellent customer service and building long-term relationships with key clients.

💹 Sales Figures vs. Budget
A line chart was designed to compare actual sales figures against budgeted sales figures for each month. This aids in identifying months where performance falls short of goals, allowing for corrective actions.

🌎 Sales Figures by Region/City
A map and bar chart combination was used to visualize sales figures by region or city. This provides insights into regional trends and opportunities for growth.

📊 Product Categories vs. Sales Amount
A chart or graph illustrating product categories versus sales amounts was created, offering an overview of how each category performs and guiding attention to areas that may need improvement.

🔄 Interactive Filters and Device Responsiveness
Interactive filters were implemented to allow users to customize data views based on specific customers, products, and time periods. The dashboard was designed to be responsive, ensuring accessibility on various devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

🎨 Additional Creativity
Beyond the specified visualizations, additional creative elements were introduced to enhance the overall dashboard experience. These include...

🌐 Dashboard Sharing and Continuous Monitoring
The final dashboard was published to Tableau Online for easy access by stakeholders. The link to the dashboard was shared with Chris and the team. Regular updates and feedback sessions were scheduled to ensure the dashboard remains relevant, and users were trained to effectively utilize and interpret the presented data.

🌟 Conclusion 🚀
This project showcases the successful transition from static sales reports to a dynamic and visually appealing Tableau dashboard for The Bike Haven. The implemented visualizations provide valuable insights into product performance, customer relationships, budget adherence, regional trends, and product categories. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for decision-making and performance tracking, contributing to the company's goal of reaching new heights.
